# BudgetingApp-Final
## Thomas Muniz, Kimberly Tse
A mobile application built with React Native for tracking income and expenses. Features include real-time calculation of disposable income, tax sales calculation based on state rates, and quick currency conversion. 

### Collaboration:
We utilized Live Collab via Visual Studios Code to work on the application in real-time. Final iteration will be uploaded by Thomas Muniz

### Tools
- Wireframe: Moqups
- IDE: Visual Studio Code, Xcode
- ReactNative
- Expo – library for simulating code onto desired mobile phone
- Database: MongoDB
- Collaboration: GitHub

### Gestalt Principles Utilized
- Common Region – shown through user input 
- Continuity – shown through visible scrollbar
- Proximity – shown through buttons next to the desired response
- Figure/Ground - shown when n new entry was inputted and tables coloring
- Similarity – efforts to keeping the layout and design similar across the app

### Future Work
- Continue refining design to be more aesthetic and readable
- Provide option to change color themes
- Incorporate different usage of buttons and gestures that are more natural to use
- Allow for customization of hot buttons
- Develop a backend to store users' data
